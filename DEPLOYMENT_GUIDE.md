# Supply Chain Automation System: Documentation and Deployment Guide

## 1. System Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to deploying and managing the Supply Chain Automation System. The system is designed as a modular, multi-bot platform that automates key supply chain processes, including inventory management, supplier communication, and order workflows. It features a central orchestrator bot that coordinates the activities of specialized bots, all managed through a user-friendly web dashboard.

The system is built with a flexible architecture that allows for seamless integration with third-party services like Zapier and Stripe, enabling you to connect with thousands of other applications and manage subscriptions with ease.

### Key Features:

- **Inventory Automation Bot:** Monitors stock levels, predicts stockouts and overstock situations, and provides real-time inventory analytics.
- **Supplier Management Bot:** Streamlines supplier communication, manages requests, and tracks supplier performance.
- **Auto-Reorder Bot:** Automates the reordering process with smart triggers based on inventory levels and demand forecasts.
- **Demand Forecasting Bot:** Analyzes historical data to predict future demand and optimize inventory planning.
- **Zapier Integration:** Connects to thousands of apps and services through standardized webhooks.
- **Stripe Integration:** Manages customer subscriptions and billing for premium features.
- **Comprehensive Dashboard:** Provides a centralized interface for monitoring and controlling the entire system.

## 2. System Architecture

The system is built on a modern, scalable architecture that combines a powerful Flask backend with a responsive HTML/JavaScript frontend. The backend consists of a main orchestrator application that routes requests to specialized bot modules, each handling a specific business logic.

- **Backend:** Flask, Python
- **Frontend:** HTML, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons, Chart.js
- **Database:** SQLite (for simplicity, can be upgraded to a more robust database)
- **Deployment:** The application is designed to be deployed as a standalone web server.

## 3. Deployment Guide

Follow these steps to deploy the Supply Chain Automation System on a production server:

### Prerequisites:

- A server with Python 3.8+ installed.
- `git` for cloning the repository.
- A production-ready WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI.
- A web server like Nginx or Apache to act as a reverse proxy.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your server:

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd supply-chain-automation
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Environment

Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Configure the Application

Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store your environment variables:

```
FLASK_APP=src/main.py
FLASK_ENV=production
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///src/database/app.db
STRIPE_API_KEY=<your-stripe-api-key>
ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_URL=<your-zapier-webhook-url>
```

### Step 4: Run with a Production WSGI Server

Install Gunicorn:

```bash
pip install gunicorn
```

Run the application with Gunicorn:

```bash
gunicorn --workers 4 --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 "src.main:app"
```

### Step 5: Set Up a Reverse Proxy (Nginx Example)

Create an Nginx configuration file at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/supply-chain-automation`:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

Enable the site and restart Nginx:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/supply-chain-automation /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

## 4. Zapier Integration

The system is designed for easy integration with Zapier. To connect, you will need to use the "Webhooks by Zapier" app.

1. **Create a New Zap:** In your Zapier dashboard, create a new Zap and select "Webhooks by Zapier" as the trigger.
2. **Choose a Trigger:** Select "Catch Hook" as the trigger event.
3. **Get Your Webhook URL:** Zapier will provide you with a unique webhook URL. Copy this URL.
4. **Subscribe to Events:** Use the systemâ€™s API to subscribe to the events you want to monitor. You will need to send a POST request to the `/api/webhooks/subscribe` endpoint with the event name and your Zapier webhook URL.

Example subscription request:

```json
{
  "trigger_event": "inventory.stockout",
  "webhook_url": "<your-zapier-webhook-url>"
}
```

## 5. Stripe Integration

To enable subscription management, you need to configure your Stripe API key in the `.env` file. The system provides endpoints for creating and managing subscriptions.

- `POST /api/subscription/create`: Creates a new subscription for a customer.
- `GET /api/subscription/status`: Checks the status of a subscription.

## 6. Conclusion

This guide provides all the necessary information to deploy and manage the Supply Chain Automation System. For more detailed API documentation, please refer to the OpenAPI/Swagger documentation available at the `/api/docs` endpoint of your deployed application.
